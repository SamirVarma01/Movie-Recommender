Movie Recommender

This project takes user input for their favorite movie and recommends similar movies based on keywords, genre, director, and cast. It uses cosine similarity and a nearest neighbors algorithm. 

The cos_sim.py file is an example of how cosine similarity works, and is what I used to understand the concept.
